Starting the bot and chatting
Starting the bot simply requires you to log into the panel using the default "username: Admin and password: Administrator", from there, it will automatically load the panel, you will see three buttons, "Start, Stop and Send". The first button to press is Start, this will start the bot up and automatically send it the signal to join your server, once joined if your server has AuthMe installed, the bot will automatically execute the following command "/register (bot_password) (bot_password)" which will register the bot the first time it joins the server, the next time it joins the server, it will execute "/login (bot_password)" which will log the bot into your server, once it joined you need to set it's gamemode to spectator, if you have Multiverse Core, create a world with it and set it's default gamemode to creative or spectator to keep the bot from dying in any way possible, once that's done, you're good to go, and to chat as the bot, use the console and select the chat box, type in your text and click/tap Send.
